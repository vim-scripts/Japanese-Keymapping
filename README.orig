These keympas allow you to input Japanese characters (Hiragana and Katakana
only, no Kanji yet) from within Vim by typing in their phonetic romanji
equivalent.

For more info on how to use key mappings, see the following help sections:
	:help keymap
	:help mbtye-keymap
	:help mbyte.txt

To install this keymap place kana.vim in your keymap directory. To find out
where that is look at:
	:echo $VIM.
For more info see
	:help $VIM

= USE =

You will have to change your 'encoding' to utf8. To see what your current
'encoding' is set to run
	:set encoding?
To set your encoding to utf8, enter
	:set encoding=utf-8
For more info see
	:help encoding.

In order to start typing in japanese characters, you must enter
	:set keymap=kana
To turn off these keymaps and just start typing in the latin alphabet just enter
	:set keymap=
While typing in japanese characters lower case characters correspond to hiragana
and uppercase characters correspond to katakana

If you only see boxes while trying to type in japanese characters, your font
doesn't support japanese characters. Try changing font.
