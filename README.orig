			   Japanese Characters in Vim
	       Written by Rory McCann <ebelular at gmail dot com>


Contents of Japanese Keymapping package:

	japanese-hiranga_utf8.vim
	japanese-katakan_utf8.vim


These keympas allow you to input Japanese characters (Hiragana and Katakana
only, no Kanji yet) from within Vim by typing in their phonetic romanji
equivalent.

For more info on how to use key mappings, see the following help sections:
	:help keymap
	:help mbtye-keymap
	:help mbyte.txt

To use these keymappings places japanese-hiranga_utf8.vim and
japanese-katakan_utf8.vim files in your keymap folder. To find out where that
is look at
	:echo $VIM.
For more info see
	:help $VIM

You will have to change your 'encoding' to utf8. To see what your current
'encoding' is set to run
	:set encoding?
To set your encoding to utf8, enter
	:set encoding=utf-8
For more info see
	:help encoding.

In order to start typing in japanese characters, you must enter
	:set keymap=japanese-hiragana_utf8
for hiragana, or
	:set keymap=japanese-katakana_utf8
for katakana. To turn off these keymaps and jsut start typing in the latin
alphabet just enter
	:set keymap=

If you are going to be switching between the 3 then I suggest the following 3 mappings to make it easier.
	:imap <C-H> <C-O>:set keymap=japanese-hiragana_utf8<ENTER>
	:imap <C-K> <C-O>:set keymap=japanese-katakana_utf8<ENTER>
	:imap <C-E> <C-O>:set keymap=<ENTER>
If you do this then pressing CONTROL-H will switch it so you are entering hiragana etc.

If you only see boxes while trying to type in japanese characters, your font
probably doesn't support japanese characters. Try changing font.

from Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org>, it's a great resource, check it out.
